# Homebridge GPIO WiringPi - Platform Plugin

***

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Please report issues at https://github.com/rsg98/homebridge-gpio-wpi2/issues

***

Supports triggering General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi.

Uses wiringPi as a back end to give non-root access to GPIO.

## Requirements

-	[Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) - _HomeKit support for the impatient_
-	[node-wiring-pi](https://github.com/rsg98/node-wiring-pi) - _Node.js bindings to wiringPi_

This version of the plugin expects WiringPi itself to already be installed - see the documentation for [node-wiring-pi](https://github.com/rsg98/node-wiring-pi)
for more details, or just follow the instructions below for Raspbian.

## Installation

1.	Install the wiringpi package using `sudo apt-get install wiringpi`
2.    Install Homebridge using `sudo npm install -g homebridge`
3.	Install this plugin `sudo npm install -g homebridge-gpio-wpi2`
4.	Update your configuration file - see `config-platform-sample.json` in this repo
5.    Make sure your `homebridge` user is in the `gpio` group.

 ```Shell
  $ sudo usermod -G gpio homebridge
 ```

## Configuration

**The pin numbers used in this config file are the BCM pin numbers, not the physical pins or WiringPi pin numbers.**

You can run `gpio readall` to generate a table showing how the BCM pin numbers map to the physical pins, which varies between models of Raspberry Pi.

```json
{ 
    "platforms": [{
          "platform" : "WiringPiPlatform",
          "name" : "Pi GPIO (WiringPi)",
          "overrideCache" : "true",
          "autoExport" : "true",
          "gpiopins" : [{
                "name" : "GPIO2",
                "pin"  : 27,
                "enabled" : "true",
                "mode" : "out",
                "pull" : "down",
                "inverted" : "false",
                "duration" : 0,
                "polling" : "true"
	        },{
                "name" : "GPIO3",
                "pin"  : 22,
                "enabled" : "true",
                "mode" : "out",
                "pull" : "down",
                "inverted" : "false",
                "duration" : 0
          }]
    }]
}

```
### Platform Config Items

| Config Item | Valid Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `platform` | `WiringPiPlatform` | Must be set to this value to initialise this plugin |
| `name` | `string` | What you want this platform to be called (appears in the logs and such like) |
| `overrideCache` | `true / false` | Homebridge will cache all your accessories - setting this to true will ignore the cached value (direction, mode, etc.) and read them direcly from your config file |
| `autoExport` | `true / false` | As long as your homebridge user has permission (i.e. is a member of the `gpio` group), setting this to `true` will automatically export the pins via sysfs, meaning you _don't_ need a set-gpio.sh script |


### Pin Config Items

| Config Item | Valid Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | Initial display name for the PIN accessory - can be renamed in HomeKit app (e.g. Home) |
| `pin` | `number` | The BCM pin number - see Pin Configuration below |
| `enabled` | `true / false` | Whether you want the module to publish this pin as an accessory |
| `mode` | `out / in` | Mode the pin should operate in |
| `pull` | `up / down / off` | Configuration for the built in Pi pull up resistor |
| `inverted` | `true / false` | Reverse the behaviour of the GPIO pin (0 is on, 1 is off) |
| `duration` | `number` | Pin will turn off after this number of miliseconds |
| `polling` | `true / false` | Whether Homebridge should periodically check the status of the pin (perhaps it's being set by something external to homebridge) |


## Pin Configuration

If you don't use the `autoExport` option above, you'll need to manually configure the relevant GPIO pins using the [gpio utility](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/the-gpio-utility/
) included with wiringPi.

This _is not_ necessary if you use autoExport and your homebridge user is a member of the `gpio` group.

 +-----+-----+---------+------+---+---Pi 2---+---+------+---------+-----+-----+
```

 The pin number specified in the config.json file is the BCM pin number in this table.

 To set up the pins correctly, this module includes a `make-gpio-script` script, which
 will generate a `set-gpio.sh`.  You should run `set-gpio.sh` *before* starting Homebridge
 so that all the pins are configured.  If you start Homebridge using systemd, you can add
 `set-gpio.sh` as a ExecStartPre command in the `homebridge.service` file
 
```Shell
$ node make-gpio-script config.json set-gpio.sh
```

 The gpio tool is setuid root, so this script should be run as the user that runs Homebridge.
 
## Troubleshooting

### Homebridge reports no errors, but nothing is switched on or off

 Check the permissions in /sys/class/gpio/gpioXX - `autoExport` option should have created all these properly, if your Homebridge
 user account has the right permissions (i.e. is a member of the `gpio` group)

 ```Shell
  $ sudo usermod -G gpio homebridge
 ```
 
 If you are not using `autoExport`, you should run the `set-gpio.sh`
 script as the homebridge user (see section above to generate this script):

 ```Shell
 $ node make-gpio-script config.json set-gpio.sh
 ```
